Sign Language Detection 🤟 | Machine Learning Project
This project is a Sign Language Detection System that recognizes hand gestures used in sign language and translates them into text. It utilizes Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques to identify different signs with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
✅ Detects and classifies sign language gestures
✅ Uses Random Forest for classification
✅ Real-time detection using a webcam
✅ Preprocessed dataset for better accuracy
✅ User-friendly interface

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

OpenCV 🎥 (for image processing)

Scikit-Learn 🤖 (for machine learning)

NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib (for visualization)

📌 How It Works
Captures hand gestures using a webcam 📸

Extracts features from images 📊

Classifies the gesture using the Random Forest algorithm 🌳

Displays the recognized sign in real-time

📂 Dataset
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of hand signs, preprocessed to improve accuracy.
